BSoC Project: 2D Platformer on Unity

### Project Overview:
During BSoC, we plan to develop a 2D platformer game using Unity. The game will feature multiple levels, each with a unique design and an underlying story that unfolds during level transitions. The distinctiveness of each level will be influenced by the ongoing narrative, introducing new places, emotions, and themes.

To make the above idea clear, here is a demonstration using an example:

### Story:
The story revolves around a 5-year-old girl who has just started school. Every day, she learns something new and experiences different things. Each night, her dreams reflect the last thing she learned or experienced, and these dreams form the levels of our game. 

### Example:
- First Day of School: The girl learns about shapes and colors. That night, her dream is about shapes and colors. The level involves a square navigating a colorful room filled with obstacles. Power-ups are based on colors: a red square can dash, a blue square can float, etc.
- Learning about Animals: The next day, she learns about animals. The subsequent level features animal-themed sprites, music, and challenges.
- Family Dynamics: At some point, her parents are fighting and planning to divorce. This level could have a dark theme with rain and fog, reflecting the girl's emotional state.

### Design Approach:
Each level will be unique, allowing contributors to design their own levels independently. This approach ensures that everyone is involved in the creative process. Art and music will be handled similarly, with contributors having the freedom to create unique assets for their levels.

### Finalization:
While this is a preliminary concept, the story and game mechanics need to be finalized. Our ultimate goal is to produce a polished final product.
