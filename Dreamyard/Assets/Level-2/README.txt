This is the part-1 of level 2,
I also want to work on a part 2 of the same, to add more mechanics a bigger gameplay with harder puzzles.
I have also added some of the realted assets which can be used to enhance the looks further...

how to play:

A D : to move left and right
(Space) : to jump
Hold (Left Shift) to Activate special
press (left Ctrl) to reset, the last collected apple will also be reset.

I : for Square
J: for Circle
K: for triangle

Mechanics--
Squares are heavy they can break objects when falling or move object when special is activated...
Circles are balls tehy have a faster velocity, and can float(To be implemented in level 2)
Triangle are spikes, they can break objects while jumping, upwards...

AIM:
To collect all the apples in the level...
There are 6 apples in part 1
After collecting all the gate will open and you can change the level (Trigger in GeneralScripts/GateOpen)

DEATH:
The apples give you life, if you die the last apple you collected will respawn...
on zero apples you will respawn normally, no bad things will happen(it is a dream after all)
